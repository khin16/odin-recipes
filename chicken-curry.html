    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Pinoy Chicken Curry recipe is the Filipino version of the popular chicken curry dish. It is delicious and easy to cook. The sauce is rich, creamy, and flavorful. It goes well with warm white rice. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs. chicken cut into serving pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 piece potato cubed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>2 stalks celery sliced</li>
        <li>1 piece red bell pepper sliced</li>
        <li>2 pieces long green pepper</li>
        <li>1 piece onion chopped</li>
        <li>2 thumbs ginger cut into strips</li>
        <li>2 cups coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose cream optional</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>fish sauce and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>

        <li><h2>Fry Potato and Chicken</h2></li>
            <ul><li>Start by frying potato and chicken. Fried potato is best because it has a better texture. The same way goes with the chicken. Pan-fry these ingredients until the outer layer turns light brown. Set aside after frying</li></ul>
        <li><h2>Saute the aromatics</h2></li>
            <ul><li>These are the garlic, onion, and ginger. You will know that it is ready when the kitchen starts to smell good. Put the chicken back into the pan and season with fish sauce. The curry powder can be added afterwards.</li></ul>
        <li><h2>Cook the chicken until tender</h2></li>
            <ul><li>The chicken needs to be tenderized at this point. Pour water into the pot and let it boil. The recipe below suggests adding coconut milk towards the end of the process. However, you may combine it with water if preferred. Cook the chicken between low to medium heat until tender. Make sure that the cooking pot is covered to trap steam.</li></ul>
        <li><h2>Add the vegetables and season it</h2></li>
            <ul><li>Add the fried potato and other vegetables afterwards. This is also the part in the recipe wherein coconut milk is added. It is your choice whether to add it earlier or later in the process. By the way, make sure to adjust the taste by adding more fish sauce and ground black pepper if needed.</li></ul>
        
    </ol>
